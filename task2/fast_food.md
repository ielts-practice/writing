## Imposing a higher tax on fast food is a good way to limit its consumption. Agree or not?

## Response
In contemporary society, the significance of food-related health is widely acknowledged, with government and fast-paced nature of life playing pivotal roles in shaping individuals dietary habits. However, a contentious debate revolves around whether governments should heighten tax on fast food. Advocates contend that it is an effective initiative preventing people from suffering from health problems, while critics caution that the consequences outweigh the benefits. In this essay, I will delve into both sides of the argument, analyzing the potential consequences and benefits, and finally, offer my perspective on striking a balance between the two pointviews.

On one hand, proponents of increasing taxes on fast food caution that such food is detrimental to public health and its consumption should be limited by imposing higher taxes. The demand for convenient and fast foods has been driven by the increasing number of working individuals, hectic schedules, hustle and bustle of urban life and the desire for instant gratification. Over the past few decades, fast foods have been cheap and easily accessible, making it an attractive option for individuals seeking quick and convenient meals. While it is initially anticipated to offer a financially friendly option for individuals with limited incomes, the practical reality reveals that its perceived affordability inadequately reflects the profound enduring expenses it incurs. Indulging in such foods, which usually contain high fat, salt and sugar, can lead to detrimental impacts on individual health and well-being, thus, in turn, creating a ripple effect that places an undue strain and burden on the public healthcare system over time. One practical approach to alleviate such a long-term fallout is limiting fast food consumption by increasing taxes, through which governments can help level the playing field, channeling the tax revenue towards bolstering healthier and nutritious food choices which emphasize higher levels of protein, essential vitamins and dietary fiber. 

Moreover, higher taxes on fast food can serve as a deterrent for excessive consumption. Research has shown that price increases can influence consumer behavior, and a tax on fast food could lead individuals to think twice before indulging in these calorie-dense, nutrient-poor meals. This behavioral and ideological change could lead to a reduction in fast food consumption to a certain extent and, in turn, a decline in the prevalence of associated health problems.

On the other hand, opponents argue that imposing a higher tax on fast food may disproportionately impact low-income individuals, who often rely on these affordable options due to financial constraints. Consequently, it potentially drives them to a state of desperation, and even pushes them towards resorting to criminal activities for food. For instance, homeless individuals, facing even more limited resources due to increased fast food prices, may resort to theft or robbery as a means to obtain food, and then governments need to allocate more budget on police force and equipment to decrease related crime rate. This immediate consequence could negatively outweigh the potential long-term health fallout. To solve the dilemma, governments can counteract this by involving education, awareness campaigns and using the tax revenue to subsidize healthier food choices, thus promoting well-rounded nutrition for all socio-economic groups.

In conclusion, while imposing a higher tax on fast food is not a silver bullet or a panacea, I believe it can be a valuable tool in combatting escalating health problems caused by unhealthy eating habits, with a comprehensive and well-thought-out approach that also includes education, awareness campaigns, and government incentivizing accessible healthier food options.
